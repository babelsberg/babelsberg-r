Stuff to do before public launch
================================

* Move to new github org
* Website
* Blog post
* Confirm with Evan and Charles Nutter that all "hard problems" are done correctly
* Documentation (including how to contribute)
* Public mailing list
* Anything in the github issue tracker marked for launch
* Binaries (with nightly builds preferably)
