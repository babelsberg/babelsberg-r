Stuff to do before public launch
================================

* Change the name to `topaz` and move to new github org
* Website
* Blog post
* Working rubyspec and not embarrassing pass rate
  * Web page with passing status (maybe)
* Confirm with Evan and Charles Nutter that all "hard problems" are done correctly
* Documentation (including how to contribute)
* Public mailing list
* Anything in the github issue tracker marked for launch
* Binaries (with nightly builds preferably)
