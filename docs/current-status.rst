Current Status
==============

At present, Topaz is believed to be mostly-stable, but not tested in the real
world, and extremely incomplete. We do not yet consider Topaz to be production
ready (but it gets closer every day!).

Topaz is untested on Windows (but we'd love to improve this!), it is tested on
OS X and Linux.

The following is a list of known missing features:

* Most of the standard library is missing.
* No threading support.
* No fibers.
* No ``call/cc``.
* No method visibility (``private``).
* Many builtin methods are missing.

Remember, :doc:`you can help </contributing>`!
